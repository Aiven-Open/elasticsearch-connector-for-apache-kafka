[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aiven/aiven-kafka-connect-elasticsearch.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/aiven/aiven-kafka-connect-elasticsearch)

This repository includes a sink [Kafka Connect](http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#connect) connectors for Elasticsearch.

The project originates from Confluent [kafka-connect-elasticsearch](https://github.com/confluentinc/kafka-connect-elasticsearch). The code was forked before the change of the project's license. We want to thank the Confluent team for their efforts in developing the connector and aim to continue keeping this fork well-maintained and truly open.
